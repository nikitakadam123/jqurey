    <p id="wiki">Wikipedia has been praised for its enablement of the democratization of knowledge, extent of coverage,
        unique structure, culture, and reduced degree of commercial bias. It has been criticized for exhibiting systemic
        bias, particularly gender bias against women and ideological bias.[9][10] The reliability of Wikipedia was
        frequently criticized in the 2000s, but has improved over time, as Wikipedia has been generally praised in the
        late 2010s and early 2020s.[3][9][11] The website's coverage of controversial topics such as American politics
        and major events like the COVID-19 pandemic and the Russian invasion of Ukraine has received substantial media
        attention.[12][13][14] It has been censored by world governments, ranging from specific pages to the entire
        site.[15][16] On 3 April 2018, Facebook and YouTube announced that they would help users detect fake news by
        suggesting fact-checking links to related Wikipedia</p>
