    <p id="wiki">Wikipedia was launched by Jimmy Wales and Larry Sanger on January 15, 2001. Sanger coined its name as a blend of
        wiki and encyclopedia. Wales was influenced by the "spontaneous order" ideas associated with Friedrich Hayek and
        the Austrian School of economics after being exposed to these ideas by the libertarian economist Mark
        Thornton.[5] Initially available only in English, versions in other languages were quickly developed. Its
        combined editions comprise more than 60 million articles, attracting around 2 billion unique device visits per
        month and more than 15 million edits per month (about 5.7 edits per second on average) as of January 2023.[6][7]
        In 2006, Time magazine stated that the policy of allowing anyone to edit had made Wikipedia the "biggest (and
        perhaps best) encyclopedia in the world"</p>
